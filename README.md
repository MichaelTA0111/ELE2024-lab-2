# ELE2024 lab 2

## About This Lab
This is a lab for module ELE2024 - Circuits and Control. It uses Python to code a controller for an inverted pendulum

## My Submission
My submission contains a Python source file for each of questions 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6.1.
The source file main defines global variables which are used in most/all questions.
The source file "utilities.py" includes definitions of functions which are used in multiple questions.
Every graph is saved as a .svg file to store vector graphics. All graphs are stored inside the "figures" folder.
